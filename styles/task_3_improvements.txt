Q) Tell us about the possible reasons that the filter your implemented in part 2 did not help the customer experience.

A) They may want to be able to search by state or by surrounding cities in an x-mile radius using their current location. 
Perhaps picking just one city is too restrictive. Additionally they may want to filter by other factors such as date and price.


Q) What could you change to improve the filter experience, and why do you think it would be better for the customer?

A) I would expand on the filter to allow them to filter by maximum price. I would also implement the abilty to filter for venues that are with in a 10, 20 or 50 mile radius from you.

I believe that filtering by radius to you would force me to manipulate the Viagogo API to include more informaton about the exact address of the venues, I am not going to implement that one
A price filter is also pretty tricky since we are only given minimum price, theres no way to know about the price of the other tickets.
